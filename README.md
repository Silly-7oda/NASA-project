Welcome to the Meteor Madness Challenge! üöÄ

This website is a simplified demonstration of the full version. Due to certain limitations, this version only includes basic functionality and does not feature the complete set of tools or interactions found in the final product.

Despite its simplicity, we hope it helps showcase the core idea and meets your expectations as part of our humble project.

PROJECT DETAILS:

- FEATURES

Live integration with NASA NEO API & USGS datasets.

3D orbital paths + impact zone maps (blast, crater, tsunami, seismic).

Interactive controls for asteroid size, velocity, and deflection strategies.

Dual modes: Science (raw data, exports) & Public (infographics, simplified views).

Gamified ‚ÄúDefend Earth‚Äù mode for outreach.

- WORKFLOW

Fetch asteroid + environmental data.

Run trajectory & impact-energy simulations (mass, KE, crater scaling).

Visualize results on a 3D globe and 2D hazard maps.

Users test scenarios & mitigation (e.g., kinetic impactors).

Share results or reports.

- BENEFITS

Makes complex asteroid science accessible.

Supports decision makers with scenario modeling.

Educates and engages the public through visuals & gamification.

Encourages global preparedness by merging siloed datasets.

TOOLS USED:

Backend: HTML

Frontend: NODE.JS

Data: NASA NEO API, USGS topography & seismic/tsunami data, OpenTopography DEMs.

Infra: Docker, Redis, optional cloud hosting.

AI tools used: Claude Sonnet 4.5, and some help from ChatGPT in writing.
